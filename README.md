# Movie Trailer Website
A simple website to list your favorite movies including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL.

## Description
It takes input from the user - the number of movies to show on the web page (max 20). Then it takes the movie `titles` one by one and fetches the `movie poster URL` and `movie trailer URL` using OMDB API and Youtube DOM parsing respectively. Once all the information is fetched, it shows all the movies on the web page.
